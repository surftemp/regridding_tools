The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) funded the development of the Interim-CDR (ICDR) extension and production of ICDR during 2022. From 2023 onwards the production of the ICDR is funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC grant reference number NE/X019071/1, Earth Observation Climate Information Service) and the UK Marine and Climate Advisory Service (UKMCAS), benefitting from the Earth Observation Investment Package of the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology.",
